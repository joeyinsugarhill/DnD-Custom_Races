      <h4>FORECLAIMERS</h4>
      <p>Foreclaimers are an ancient ancestor to modern elves with no concept of empathy. These elves use sun-charged crystals for power themselves. Any racial traits are lost when unpowered.</p>
	  <h5>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h5>
	  <p>They are on average 6'8" tall with a quite slim body. When Powered. Their skin is mostly Grey, with glowing lines across their skin reminiscent of circuitry. A 3" long power crystal of various colors sits above where their navel would be. These crystals are the source of their enhanced power and glowing lines. It can be freely removed from its socket.</p>
	  <p><span class="feature">Unpowered.</span> When a Foreclaimer's power crystal is removed from its socket, they begin to grow weak and the purple lines disappear. If left unpowered for more than a year, they will slowly begin to degrade over the course of 100 years, eventually reducing their lifespan by half. A Foreclaimer who has been unpowered for more than a year can also begin to gain negative effects such as memory loss, developing strange obsessions or habits, and at worst growing feeble.</p>
	  <h5>HISTORY</h5>
	  <p>Foreclaimers were originally ancestors of high elves that have enhanced and augmented themselves using sun-based technology over 2,500 years ago. They were solely focused on the advancement of their technology and physiology. Most of their science is based on the power harvested from the sun, which they use to power machines and enhance their own bodies. The energy they harvested from the sun was stored in large power crystals, basically batteries, which were then used as parts of machines. It is unknown how they acquired such advanced technology, or how the crystals were used to enhance their lifespans. Foreclaimers could not perceive the concept of empathy or many emotions in general. However, contrary to their lack of empathy, they were a society without currency or trade. Each member had assigned duties from their current elected leader, more often than not the head scientist, which contributed to the progression of their society.</p>
	  <h5>SOCIETY</h5>
	  <p>Foreclaimers are extremely efficient and focused on their work. Their goal is advancing their civilization by advancing technology and biology, using energy harvested from the sun and even souls. Distractions or interruptions are not tolerated and removed quickly. Foreclaimers do not possess the concept of empathy, or artistic creativity. To them, these are inefficient social constructs that do not belong in their society. If a member of society is crippled, disabled, or injured beyond simple care, they are left to die and disposed of unceremoniously. They don't grieve losses and don't hold funerals, as those emotions are merely a distraction from their important work. When a Foreclaimer reaches adulthood, they are put through a medical procedure where the socket for the power crystal is surgically inserted, and then powered up. Foreclaimers tend to themselves and do not get along with any other races, reinforced by the fact that they lack the concept of empathy. They may establish a relationship with members of another race if it furthers their goals, but more likely they will simply destroy them through highly efficient warfare instead. Foreclaimers establish huge cities where the lands support their goals through either resources or tactical location. Most of their society is located in a single city in the jungle, as that's most efficient, with only a few outposts for exploration. Foreclaimers do not believe in deities, nor follow any established religions. They only care about their work and facts. <br/> In extremely rare cases, a Foreclaimer can develop a sense of empathy and belonging, usually when isolated, and exposed to members of other races, such as in an adventuring party. These Foreclaimers, while rare, are shunned from their society, but not killed, as killing a rogue Foreclaimer will only take time and resources better spent elsewhere. These rogue Foreclaimers may develop a caring, compassionate personality if inducted into an adventuring party where they can get attention and friendship. However, some Foreclaimers may start to feel hate and anger, possibly from being shunned by their own people. These Foreclaimers may even start experimenting with themselves, trying to create more powerful augmentations to destroy something they feel hatred towards.</p>

	  <span class="feature">Subrace.</span>Adult Foreclaimers may choose to accept a type of body augmentation and subsequently be classified as a subrace.

The removal and insertion of a new crystal takes a toll on the Foreclaimer's body, and requires a long rest for the effects of the new crystal to take place.<br/>
